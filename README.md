# Rent vs Buy – Financial Decision Engine (India)

A decision-grade financial model to evaluate **renting vs owning a house** using cash-flow realism, opportunity cost, and scenario analysis.

This tool exists to answer one question:

> Over a chosen time horizon, which choice results in higher net worth — renting and investing the difference, or buying a home?

No emotional framing.  
No one-year math.  
No hidden assumptions.

## Why this exists

Most rent vs buy calculators:
- Treat EMI as an investment
- Ignore opportunity cost of down payment
- Ignore transaction costs
- Assume optimistic appreciation
- Compare monthly costs instead of **net worth**

This model fixes that.

It is designed to be:
- Transparent
- Auditable
- Stress-testable
- Suitable for real financial decisions

## What the model includes

### Renting scenario
- Annual rent escalation
- Investment of surplus cash flow
- Compounding of investments
- Down payment invested instead of locked

### Buying scenario
- EMI calculated from first principles
- Interest vs principal separation
- Maintenance and property tax
- Stamp duty at entry
- Selling costs at exit
- Property appreciation over time

### Comparison
- Year-by-year net worth
- Final net worth at exit
- Net worth crossover visualization
- Scenario analysis (bear / base / bull)

The comparison is **net worth vs net worth**, not rent vs EMI.

## Who this is for

- Financial planners
- Analysts
- Serious home buyers
- Anyone who wants math instead of narratives

This is **not** a marketing calculator.
